<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Users will have the opportunity to either research a variety of workouts and local fitness groups, or research for nutritional recipes and local restaurants to maintain their fitness goals. At the Workout Page, users will select which muscle group they want to focus and the corresponding workouts associated with the muscle groups. The user will then be shown a description of the exercises along with a Workout Tutorial section for illustration and variations of the exercise. In addition, users will have the option to find a support network around their area which may share similar fitness goals and recreational acitivites. At the Nutrition Page, users will be able to input their favorite foods to research healthier recipes which stay align with their diet. If the user is on the go, the user wil be able to find local restaurants around the area which allows the user to find nutritional restaurants nearby or explore their surroundings for a cheat day. Both the Workout and Nutritional pages are interchangeable, which allows users to switch from researching exercise tutorials to nutrition related content at their convenience.</p>
